# About Me

I am currently taking a much needed break from tech, and an undetermined hiatus from public speaking and advocacy. I am currently focusing on taking a few calm breaths in the coldest and cleanest air I can find. 2020 has been rough for everyone and right now I just want to remain in touch with what grounds me, mountains.

You can find an enormous amount of information about me on the internet. Just google [kris nova](https://www.google.com/search?q=kris+nova) and I imagine the first few hits will give you an idea of what I have done in the past. 

## A few notable resources

I hand selected these resources to show technical depth. They span many different media channels.

#### Nivenly.com

[Vist nivenly.com](https://nivenly.com)

This is a good resource, and was just "soft launched" back on my local server cabinet in my studio. It's a good "at a glance" view and runs on [NOVIX](https://github.com/kris-nova/novix) which is clockwork project of mine for building the ultimate secure Kubernetes system on arm and arm64 chips. 

#### Clusterfuck Talks

I would prefer to not share too many of my public speaking talks, but these ones show the depth of what I can prepare technically well. At the very least view these as representation of me being able to bring digestible consideration to any engineering discussion. 

 - [View Part 1 2018 "The Clusterfuck hidden in the Kubernetes code base"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VNDjwzzKPo&ab_channel=source%7Bd%7D)
 - [View Part 2 2019 "Fixing the Kubernetes clusterfuck"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrtkKgfJ3RI&ab_channel=KrisN%C3%B3va)
 
 Both of these were performed at FOSDEM courtesy of my previous two employers (Heptio, and Sysdig) and the FOSDEM community.
 
 #### Cloud Native Infrastructure
 
 [Buy several copies for your immediate and distant friends and family for the holidays today!](https://www.cnibook.info/)
 
 I wrote the book on it. Literally. Well it was me and my great pal Justin Garrison anyway. This is based on years of infrastructure and SRE experience this book talks about writing software to manage and mutate infrastructure. Inspired by work in Kubernetes and reconciling infrastructure using Go and Kubernetes libraries. 
 
 #### Falco
 
 [Visit falco.org](https://falco.org)
 
 I worked professionaly as a Falco maintainer and security engineer. I helped make Falco what it is today, and continue my work during my much needed unemployment. 
 
 #### Kubernetes Systems Programming
 
 Just going to share a few resources that I co-founded, maintained, created, or contributed to. A lot of these helped me in my work to write Cloud Native Infrastructure. To not give it justice -- if it involved building a Kubernetes cluster -- I was probably along for the ride at some point. 
 
  - [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
  - [kubicorn](https://github.com/kubicorn/kubicorn)
  - [sig-cluster-lifecycle](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle/README.md)
  - [sig-aws](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws)
  - [cluster-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api)
  
  I try to keep my involvement with SIGs on a need-only basis so despite being involved with many others (sig-security, sig-apimachinery, etc) I was routinely involved just to accomplish a single concrete task.

  # What I am looking for
  
  Now for the reason you are all here. I am trying to define clearly what it is I am currently looking for in employment in the hopes of finding a close match. 
  
  Let's start by defining very clearly what I am **not** looking for.
  
  #### Boundaries 
  
   - **Twitter.** This is mine. What I say is my personal opinion and absolutely under no circumstance will ever represent one of my employers. I cannot be a Twitter spokesperson for your company. This is non-negotiable. 
   - **Marketing/Public Speaking.** I am happy to prepare presentations. I am happy to give speaches. I am happy to speak at tech events when it makes sense. I am happy to attend events when it makes sense. I will not under no-circumstance offer myself as a marketing instrument. This is non-negotiable. 
   - **Remote Work** At least until me and my family feel it is safe to return a work environment I will be a remote worker. I thrive on public interaction and working closely with my peers, but I am not interested in an "in your seat" work enviornment. Remote work is preferred. This is negotiable. 
   - **Open Source** I have a lot of personal open source commitments. Most of which are bound by an Apache 2 license (but there are others). I am happy to negotiate how much time I spend dedicated to any or all of these projects during employment. However if asking me to stop working on these projects completely is something you require - this is not a good match. 
   - **Fine Print** I understand that it will be in your best interest to protect company assets. My work in open source however will come with a a clear warning that my work spans the duration of employment and to be honest -- that is why I am valuable.
   
 Now let's talk about what I do want `:)` 
 
 ## My Perfect Role
 
 I want to build something. I miss the days of writing code with a good team of folks and working towards building something we are proud of. 
 
 Real, concrete problems are probably the best way to attract me. If your shit is broken, we should talk. 
 
 #### Security
 
 I would like to continue my security engineering and kernel work. This includes working on and with tools such as
 
  - eBPF
  - The kernel (tracepoints, system calls, architecture, etc)
  - Falco

  
  #### Languages
  
  - I write `Go` for many reasons, and it can quite often be the right tool for the job. Who doesn't want a well distributed staticaly linked binary with a beautiful cross compiler these days?
  - However my true love is `C` and `C++`. I look at these like my wife I have been married to for a decade. I love her but I can't stand her cooking.
  - `Rust` is exciting for many reasons
  - I will be writing `bash` and if you have a concern with that this isn't a good fit. 
  
  #### Kubernetes
  
  We go way back. I assume if you are here you are interested in Kubernetes in some way. Happy to talk more. Even happier to talk less. 
  
  #### Other Open Source
  
  Falco, Kubernetes sigs, other CNCF projects, other Linux Foundation projects, the list goes on and on. I hope you expect me to continue this work.

  # Ways to get my attention
  
I need to finance an upcoming surgery which should run about 60-70k USD. 
 
Offering to either

- Help with cost
- Help with convincing the insurance companies to cover the cost
 
 is a sure way to bump you to the top of my list. (I sincerely mean this).
 
  
  # If you are interested
  
 If you made it this far pat yourself on the back. 
 
  - Send an email to [me](mailto:nova@nivenly.com) and introduce yourself.
  - Keep the communication consolidated for my sake. 
  - Kubernetes slack is great for me. Feel free to start here as well.
